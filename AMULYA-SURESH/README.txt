Python program To transfer  file between server and client 
*****
1) create a file mytext.txt
2) In the file server_file_transfer.py ,we will be creating a SOCKET,nad then we will BIND,LISTEN and the ACCEPT the connection.
3)here the server reads the concent of the file and sends it to client
4) in the file client_file_transfer.py the recieved.txt is automatically created as we use write("wb") on it.
hence when run in two terminals ,the server when run in the terminals reads the contents of file and when the client is run it is stored onto another file .
